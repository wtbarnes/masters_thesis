\chapter{Coronal Loops}
\label{ch:coronal_loops}
\hl{This chapter will discuss the discrete nature of corona in terms of coronal loop structures
Need a section on general plasma dynamics of loops to discuss energy transfer/loss/gain through heating/enthalpy/radiation/draining/filling
Also discuss general structure and how they are formed
Give some general characteristics about them like length, temperature, density, through what layers they extend etc.
Show nice schematic}
The solar corona is typically described in terms of discrete structures known as coronal loops. Heated   
\section{Observations}
\label{sec:observations}
\hl{Discuss some observations of loops and what has been learned about them, what constraints, multi-stranded versus single stranded
Show some pretty pictures}
\section{Modeling}
\label{sec:modeling}
\hl{Discuss modeling approaches, hydrodynamics versus magnetohydrodynamics, etc.}
