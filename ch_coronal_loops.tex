\par As discussed in \S\ref{subsec:dynamo_flux}, magnetic field lines emerge from below the photosphere due to magnetic bouyancy and differential rotation, extending high into the atmosphere with their footpoints rooted in the solar surface. Those field lines that are closed (both footpoints line-tied) form arch-like structures called \textit{coronal loops}, the primary building blocks of the highly structured solar corona \citep{reale_coronal_2010}. Because $\beta<1$ in the corona (see Fig. \ref{fig:plasma_beta}), the plasma is strongly confined such that the flow is directed primarily along the field with negligible cross-field motion. Thus, the enormously complicated magnetic field provides the scaffolding for the coronal plasma. As a consequence of this confinement, loops are individually isolated, leading to the observed inhomogeneity seen in the corona \citep{reale_coronal_2010}. Fig. \ref{fig:loops_example} shows several distinct loop structures, both on-disk and off-limb, as observed in the 171 \ang channel of SDO/AIA.

\par Coronal loops, because of their relatively high temperatures ($\sim10^5-10^7$ K), are observed primarily in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and x-ray bands, with an associated wavelength range of $1\sim100$ \ang. While most coronal loop temperatures exceed $10^5$ K, loop plasma can span a range of temperatures and densities, due to both the complexity of the underlying field and the fact that individual loops are thermally isolated. As a result, loops are often categorized based on their thermal properties: \textit{cool}, 0.1-1 MK, \textit{warm}, 1-1.5 MK, and \textit{hot}, $\ge2$ MK \citep{reale_coronal_2010}. Whether these thermal categories actually represent distinct classes of loops or if they are all just transient states of the same type of loop is an open question in the coronal loops community, with the main debate revolving around whether different physical processes are at work in each type of loop. Additionally, loops have also been observed in several topologically differnt features on the Sun. See Table \ref{tab:loop_params} for some typical parameters associated with these distinct regions. This work will focus primarily on simulating loops in active regions, where many hot, nonflaring loops have been observed and emission from loop plasma is unlikely to be contaminated by radiation from the underlying transition region \citep{tripathi_emission_2011,warren_constraints_2011,warren_systematic_2012,winebarger_using_2011}. 
%\par Unfortunately, observational measurements of the coronal magnetic field are difficult and often involve a number of restrictive assumptions regarding the field topology and dynamics. Solar magnetograms can be constructed from measurements of the photospheric field through the effect of Zeeman splitting on spectral lines. The coronal field is then extrapolated, using the magnetogram as a lower boundary condition \citep[see][Ch. 5]{aschwanden_physics_2006}. While these extrapolation techniques can provide much insight into coronal loop topology, conclu
