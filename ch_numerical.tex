\chapter{Numerical Modeling}
\label{ch:numerical}
This chapter will outline our numerical approach to studying the solar corona
\section{One-dimensional Hydrodynamics}
\label{sec:1dhydro}
List the 1D hydrodynamic equations and briefly discuss their origin (i.e. how they were derived) and how they differ from MHD approach
Include plasma $\beta$ justification of why we don't include the magnetic field
Emphasize terms that are ``non-standard'' hydrodynamic terms (e.g. radiation, heat flux, ad-hoc heating, enthalpy transfer)
Bring up HYDRAD model and discuss speed limitations
\section{The EBTEL Model}
\label{sec:ebtel}
Derive the EBTEL equations from the 1D hydrodynamic equations and discuss the physics behind the EBTEL model; what physics is left out? what physical insight can we still gain from this model?
Say why EBTEL is important (i.e. large parameter sweeps that can't be done with HYDRAD)
Discuss 0D nature, maybe include discussion of previous 0D models and why EBTEL is better
Show comparisons between EBTEL and HYDRAD
\section{The Two-fluid EBTEL Model}
\label{sec:ebtel2fl}
Discuss importance of two-fluid effects in hydrodynamic models of the solar corona; include some quick calculations to show how electron and ion fluids can become decoupled
Derive two-fluid EBTEL equations from 1D hydrodynamic equations
Show several comparisons between HYDRAD and two-fluid EBTEL to justify its use in this study
If there is time, discuss speed comparison between EBTEL and HYDRAD
