\chapter{Emission Diagnostics}
\label{ch:emission}
%
\par In solar physics (and astrophysics in general), all observational data must be collected through \textit{remote sensing} techniques rather than \textit{in situ} measurements due to the great distances and extreme environments inherent to the discipline. This means that atomic data and spectroscopy must be used to infer properties about the coronal plasma, including the temperature and density. To a good approximation, the hot, tenuous coronal plasma is \textit{optically thin} to radiation emitted in the visible, ultraviolet (UV), and x-ray bands. This means that, between the observer and where the radiation was produced, the photons were not scattered or absorbed and reemitted. As a result, the observed radiation contains signatures of the plasma that produced it and has not been polluted by some intermediate process.

\section{Spectral Line Intensity}
\label{sec:spectral_lines}
%
\par As discussed in \S\ref{sec:coronal_heating}, spectroscopy has been a critically important tool in solar physics since the discovery of the million-degree corona. Modern observing instruments and techniques have allowed for the collection of an unprecedented amount of data at increasingly higher spatial resolution and temporal cadence. However, interpreting this spectroscopic data in terms of useful plasma parameters (e.g. density and temperature) continues to pose a challenge to both observers and modelers alike.
%
\par The dominant emission mechanism in the high-temperature, low-density solar corona is \textit{bound-bound} emission,
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:bound_bound}
	X_j^{+m}\to X_i^{+m} + h\nu_{j,i},
\end{equation}
where $X$ represents the atomic species, $m$ is the charge state, $h$ is Planck's constant, and $\nu_{j,i}$ is the frequency of the emitted photon of energy $\Delta E_{j,i} = h\nu_{j,i}=hc/\lambda_{j,i}$, with $j$ and $i$ representing the bound and lower energy states, respectively \citep{mason_spectroscopic_1994}. In this process, ion $X^{+m}$ spontaneously decays from excited state $j$ to lower-energy state $i$, emitting a photon of frequency $\Delta E_{j,i}$. The associated emissivity (power per unit volume) for the transition can then be written as 
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:emissivity}
	P(\lambda_{j,i})=N_j(X^{+m})A_{j,i}\Delta E_{j,i},
\end{equation}
where $N_j(X^{+m})$ is the number density of element $X$ with charge state $+m$ in excited state $j$ and $A_{j,i}$ is the Einstein spontaneous emission coefficient. Thus, the power for a given spectral line is dependent on both the number of ions of a particular charge state and the number of ions in that particular charge state who are also in an excited state \citep{mason_spectroscopic_1994,bradshaw_collisional_2013}. Finally, this volumetric power can be related to the observed line intensity as at Earth,
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:intensity}
	I(\lambda_{j,i}) = \frac{1}{4\pi R^2}\int_V \mathrm{d}V~P(\lambda_{j,i}),
\end{equation}
where the integral is taken over the entire sphere of radius $R$, where $R$ is the distance to the observer, and then normalized by the surface area of the sphere.
%
\par The next question is of course how these measured line intensities can be related to the properties of the coronal plasma. In Eq. \ref{eq:emissivity}, $A_{j,i}$ can be calculated from laboratory experiments for a given transition and $\Delta E_{j,i}$ is easily found provided $\lambda_{j,i}$ is known. The remaining quantity, $N_j(X^{+m})$ can be expressed as a series of ratios,
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:density_jm}
	N_j(X^{+m})=\frac{N_j(X^{+m})}{N(X^{+m})}\frac{N(X^{+m})}{N(X)}\frac{N(X)}{N(H)}\frac{N(H)}{N_e}N_e,
\end{equation}
where $N(X^{+m})$ is the number density of element $X$ in charge state $+m$, $N(X)$ is the number density of element $X$, $N(H)$ is the number density of hydrogen, and $N_e$ is the electron number density \citep{mason_spectroscopic_1994}. Note that $N_j(X^{+m})$ has just been repeatedly multiplied by one in order to reexpress it in terms of the following ratios (from left to right in Eq. \ref{eq:density_jm}): fraction of $+m$-ions in excited state $j$, fraction of $X$ atoms in charge state $+m$, relative abundance of $X$ compared to hydrogen, and relative abundance of hydrogen compared to the number of electrons. The expression can be further simplified through the definition of the relative abundance $\mathrm{Ab}_X=N(X)/N(H)$ and the common approximation $N(H)/N_e\approx0.83$.
%
\par Eq. \ref{eq:emissivity}, and thus Eq. \ref{eq:intensity}, can be further simplified by invoking the \textit{coronal model} approximation. In optically-thin plasmas, it can be assumed that the collisional excitation and radiative decay occur from and to the ground state, respectively; in other words $i\to g$, with g representing the ground state. Additionally, the processes which determine the excitation level and those that determine the charge state are assumed to operate on disparate enough timescales such that the changes in energy level populations of the emitting ions, occurring on short timescales, can be decoupled from the changes in the charge state, occurring on longer timescales \citep{bradshaw_collisional_2013}. Using these assumptions, statistical equilibrium between the spontaneous decay and collisional excitation processes demands
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:stat_eq}
	N_g(X^{+m})N_eC^e_{g,j} = N_j(X^{+m})A_{j,g},
\end{equation}
where $C^e_{g,j}$ is the electron collisional excitation rate between $g$ and $j$ \citep{bradshaw_collisional_2013}. Plugging Eqs. \ref{eq:stat_eq} and \ref{eq:density_jm} into Eq. \ref{eq:emissivity} and letting $N_g(X^{+m})\approx N(X^{+m})$ yields
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:emissivity_simple}
	P(\lambda_{j,g})=(0.83)\mathrm{Ab}_X\Delta E_{j,g}\frac{N(X^{+m})}{N(X)}C^e_{j,g}N_e^2.
\end{equation}
Defining the \textit{contribution function} $G(T,\lambda_{j,g})=N(X^{+m})/N(X)C^e_{j,g}$, the intensity integral can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
	I(\lambda_{j,g}) = \frac{(0.83)\mathrm{Ab}_X\Delta E_{j,g}}{4\pi R^2}\int_V\mathrm{d}V~N_e^2G(T,\lambda_{j,g}).
\end{equation}
If the plasma is isothermal over the emitting volume $V$, $G(T,\lambda_{j,g})$ comes outside the integral such that 
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:intensity_isothermal}
	I(\lambda_{j,g}) = \frac{(0.83)\mathrm{Ab}_X\Delta E_{j,g}}{4\pi R^2}G(T,\lambda_{j,g})\langle\mathrm{EM}\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\langle\mathrm{EM}\rangle=\int_V\mathrm{d}V~N_e^2$ is the average \textit{emission measure}. However, in many cases, this isothermal approximation does not hold such that the intensity integral must be expressed as 
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:dem_integral}
	I(\lambda_{j,g}) = \frac{(0.83)\mathrm{Ab}_X\Delta E_{j,g}}{4\pi R^2}\int_V\mathrm{d}T~\phi(T)G(T,\lambda_{j,g}),
\end{equation}
where $\phi(T)=N_e^2\mathrm{d}V/\mathrm{d}T$ is the \textit{differential emission measure} ($\mathrm{DEM}$).

\section{Differential Emission Measure}
\label{sec:dem}
%
\par The $\mathrm{DEM}$ and $\mathrm{EM}$ provide information about the temperature distribution of the plasma. In particular, the $\mathrm{DEM}$ is a measure of the amount of emitting material at a particular temperature $T$ in the plasma. Thus, the $\mathrm{DEM}$ is an observable that any viable theory of coronal heating should be able to predict with reasonable accuracy \citep{golub_solar_2010}. Furthermore, because the $\mathrm{DEM}$ is a one-dimensional function, it provides a simple and powerful characterization of the multi-thermal coronal plasma. Unfortunately, calculating these quantities from observed line intensities is difficult because of both mathematical and data availability issues. Looking back to Eq. \ref{eq:intensity_isothermal}, one can see that, provided the line intensities and contribution functions are available over a significant range of temperatures, the emission measure can be calculated algebraically.
%
\subsection{Reconstruction Techniques}
\label{subsec:reconstruction}
%
\par If the plasma is assumed to be approximately isothermal over the emitting volume, say at temperature $T_C$, the contribution function can be taken outside of the integral as in Eq. \ref{eq:intensity_isothermal}. Furthermore, if the plasma is assumed to have a constant density over the emitting volume as well, then $\langle\mathrm{EM}\rangle\approx N_e^2V$. To determine the $T_C$, the temperature of the plasma, the emission measure for each spectral line is calculated over the appropriate temperature range,
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:em_loci}
	\langle\mathrm{EM}(T)\rangle=4\pi R^2\frac{I_j}{(0.83)\mathrm{Ab}_X\Delta E_jG_j(T,N_e)},
\end{equation}
where the contribution function $G$ for a particular spectral line $j$ at temperature $T$ and density $N_e$ can be calculated using the CHIANTI atomic database \citep{dere_chianti_1997,landi_chiantiatomic_2013}. Typically, this procedure is done for a sufficiently large sample of observed spectral line intensities and the corresponding $\langle\mathrm{EM}(T)\rangle$ curves plotted on top of each other. Because of the isothermal assumption, these curves should intersect at a common point, $(T_C,\langle\mathrm{EM}(T_C)\rangle)$ \citep{landi_chianti-atomic_2002}. Of course this isothermal condition is never actually met; thus, all curves tend to meet in a region of intersection. The more multithermal the plasma is, the broader the region of intersection will be and, consequentially, the value of $T_C$ will be less constrained, leading to indeterminate measurements of the plasma temperature. An example for a simulated data set with a very narrow temperature distribution and thus a well-determined value of $T_C$ is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:em_loci_example}. 
%

	\caption{\textbf{(a)} Simulated $\mathrm{DEM}$ curve and the resulting $\mathrm{EM}$ loci reconstruction. From the $\mathrm{DEM}$ curve, the plasma is approximately isothermal, being sharply peaked about 1 MK. Correspondingly, the $\mathrm{EM}$ loci curves intersect in a region centered on 1 MK, allowing for a well-constrained determination of $T_C$.

The colored curves show the emission measure calculation using the $\mathrm{EM}$ loci method.

Here, the $\mathrm{DEM}$ is multiplied by the temperature bin for comparison with the $\mathrm{EM}$ loci calculation. The yellow lines to the left and right of the peak show the cool and hot slope fits in the ranges $6.0<\log{T}<6.6$ and $6.6<\log{T}<7.0,$ respectively.

	\label{fig:dem_em_loci_example}
\end{figure}
%
\par Relaxing the isothermal assumption introduces a great deal more complexity. Unlike $\langle\mathrm{EM}\rangle$, $\phi(T)$ cannot be determined algebraically; instead, Eq. \ref{eq:dem_integral}, a Fredholm equation of the first kind, must be inverted to find $\phi(T)$, a task that poses well-known mathematical difficulties \citep{kashyap_markov-chain_1998}. One method for performing such an inversion is a discretization of Eq. \ref{eq:dem_integral}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:disc_dem_integral}
	I_j = \frac{(0.83)\mathrm{Ab}_X\Delta E_j}{4\pi R^2}\sum_{k=1}^N\phi_k\int^{T_{k+1}}_{T_k}\mathrm{d}T~G_j(T),
\end{equation}
where $j$ labels the spectral line and $[T_{k+1},T_k]$ is the temperature interval over which $\phi_k$ is constant. For each measured line intensity $I_j$, $\phi_k$ for $1\le k\le N$ are determined through some minimization procedure \citep{landi_monte_2012}. To calculate the $\mathrm{DEM}$ curve, an arbitrary spline or polynomial is first assumed; subsequent corrections at $T_{eff,j}$, the temperature of maximum abundance for the line intensity $I_j$, are then calculated and a spline interpolation applied to these corrections for the entire temperature range $[T_1,T_N]$. This correction is then applied to initial curve and the corrected curve is used as the initial $\mathrm{DEM}$ on the next iteration \citep{landi_monte_2012}. This method of course has the disadvantage that a functional form for the $\mathrm{DEM}$ must be chosen \textit{a priori}, biasing the temperature distribution. Additionally, a poor choice of temperature interval in Eq. \ref{eq:disc_dem_integral} can oversmooth the $\mathrm{DEM}$ curve or cause convergence issues.
%
\par An alternative method for calculating the $\mathrm{DEM}$ that has begun to gain popularity is the Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method developed by \citet{kashyap_markov-chain_1998}. Using a Bayesian approach, the goal of this method is to maximize the probability $P(X,F)$ of obtaining observed line intensities $F=(F_1,F_2,\ldots,F_n)$ from a $\mathrm{DEM}$ characterized by a set of parameters $X=(X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_m)$. First, a set of $N$ temperature bins is chosen such that within each bin, the plasma is assumed to be isothermal and can be described by an emission measure $\mathrm{EM}_i$. As a result, the set of parameters $X$ that describe the $\mathrm{DEM}$ is $X=(\mathrm{EM}_1,\mathrm{EM}_2,\ldots,\mathrm{EM}_N)$. To maximize $P(X,F)$, the parameters of $X$ are varied step by step such that the change introduced only depends on the parameters of the previous step. This new set of parameters $X^{\prime}$ has a new probability $P(X^{\prime},F)$ and this new set of parameters is accepted or rejected based on the Metropolis algorithm \citep{metropolis_equation_1953}. The emission measure values in each bin thus comprise the $\mathrm{DEM}$. Unlike other reconstruction methods, the MCMC method has the benefit of not assuming \textit{a priori} a functional form for the $\mathrm{DEM}$ curve and does not impose unphysical smoothness constraints on the final solution \citep{landi_monte_2012}.
%
\subsection{Scaling Laws}
\label{subsec:scaling}
%
\par From these emission measure distributions, simple observables can be calculated that any viable heating model should be able to produce. The most popular of these observables is the well-known scaling between the emission measure and the temperature, 
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{EM}\propto T^a.
\end{equation}
This scaling, first proposed by \citet{jordan_energy_1980}, has since been validated by both simulation and observation. A summary of model and observational results for the $a$ parameter can be found in Table \ref{tab:em_scalings}. Looking at the sample emission measure distributions in Fig. \ref{fig:dem_em_loci_example}, it can be seen that, for isothermal (Fig. \ref{fig:em_loci_example}) and multithermal (Fig. \ref{fig:dem_example}) plasmas, the emission measure distribution tends to be strongly peaked. When determining the scaling parameter $a$, it is common perform a linear fit in $(\log{T},\log{\mathrm{EM}})$ coolward of the peak, typically between 6.0 and $\log{T_{peak}}$, where $T_{peak}$ is the temperature at which $\mathrm{EM}_{max}$ occurs. Observations of the inter-moss regions of active region cores, where the emission is less likely to be contaminated by transition region lines, indicate that $2\lesssim a\lesssim5$. Table \ref{tab:em_scalings} summarizes these findings. This large range of values is most likely due to both uncertainties in the atomic data as well as the variety of techniques used to reconstruct the emission measure distribution (see \S\ref{subsec:reconstruction}).
%
\par These scalings have also recently been studied in the context of simulation. \citet{mulu-moore_can_2011}, using a 1D hydrodynamic model, constructed emission measure distributions for a $3\times3$ parameter space of loop length and equilibrium temperature using a single impulsive heating function. They found that this ``long nanoflare storm'' heating scenario, in which impulsive heating events occur infrequently on sub-resolution strands, produced emission measure slopes that were too small to adequately account for observations. Using an advanced forward modeling technique and a different 1D hydrodynamic model, \citet{bradshaw_diagnosing_2012} and \citet{reep_diagnosing_2013} investigated the effect of low-frequency and high-frequency nanoflare heating, respectively, on the resulting emission measure. \citet{bradshaw_diagnosing_2012} found that low-frequency heating could not account for the entire range of observed emission measure slopes while \citet{reep_diagnosing_2013} showed high-frequency heating could. Additionally, \citet{cargill_active_2014}, using an efficient ``0D'' hydrodynamic simulation (see \S\ref{sec:ebtel}), showed that $a$ can vary from 2 to greater than 5 depending on the heating frequency, whether the heating spectrum follows a power-law, and how the heating scales with the time between successive heating events.

%
\par As discussed in \S\ref{subsec:dc_heating}, nanoflares, short heating events on the order of $10^{24}$ ergs, are a plausible explanation for observed million-degree coronal temperatures. One strategy for testing and constraining this theory is to analyze modeled and observed emission measure distributions for signatures of impulsive heating. As with the cool emission, the hot emission is also often characterized by an emission measure slope. Typically, this linear fit on $\log{T},\log{EM}$ is done ``hotward'' of the peak, usually in the range $6.0\lesssim\log{T}\lesssim7.2$. However, measured values of these hotward slopes are poorly constrained due to both the magnitude of emission and the lack of available spectroscopic data in this temperature range. \citet{warren_systematic_2012}, using spectral measurements from \textit{Hinode}/EIS, provided hotward fits for $\mathrm{EM}$ reconstructions for a large number of active regions. All measured slopes fell in the range $6.1<|a_{hot}|<10.3$, with large uncertainties on each hotward fit. Examples of both a hotward and coolward fit on a reconstructed $\mathrm{EM}$ are shown in Fig. 
%
\subsection{Observational Difficulties}
\label{subsec:observational_difficulties}
%
\par \citet{cargill_implications_1994,cargill_nanoflare_2004} have predicted that emission measure distributions resulting from nanoflare models should be wide and have a faint, high-temperature ($>4\times10^6$ K) component and thus a steep hotward slope. Unfortunately, observing this high-temperature emission is difficult and in some cases impossible. The reason for this difficulty is twofold. First, thermal conduction is a very efficient cooling mechanism at high temperatures and large spatial temperature gradients. Thus, because the increase in density lags the increase in temperature due to heating and because $\mathrm{EM}\propto n^2$, by the time sufficient densities are acheived, the plasma has cooled down such that the fingerprints of nanoflare heating have been smoothed out. 
%
\par The second reason for this difficulty is non-equilibrium ionization. It is usually assumed that the observed line intensities, because of their known formation temperatures, are a direct indicator of the plasma temperature. However, if the heating timescale is shorter than the ionization timescale, the time it takes for the ion population to settle into the correct charge state, an equilibrium assumption can lead to a misdiagnosis of the plasma temperature. This makes signatures of hot, nanoflare-heated plasma especially difficult to detect if the high temperatures persist for less than the ionization timescale \citep{bradshaw_explosive_2006,bradshaw_what_2011,reale_nonequilibrium_2008}.
%
\par Despite these difficulties, various attempts have been made to observe this faint high-temperature emission, the so-called ``smoking gun'' of coronal nanoflares. Using the broadband X-Ray Telescope (XRT) aboard the \textit{Hinode} spacecraft, \citet{schmelz_hinode_2009} and \citet{reale_evidence_2009} show a faint hot component in the reconstructed $\mathrm{DEM}$ curves. However, since the channels on such broadband instruments can often be polluted by low-temperature emission, the reliability of such measurements depends on the filtering technique used. Additionally, \citet{winebarger_defining_2012} showed that combinations of \textit{Hinode}/EIS and \textit{Hinode}/XRT measurements leave a ``blind spot'' in the $\mathrm{EM}-T$ space conincident with where evidence for nanoflare heating is likely to be found. Unambiguous observational evidence of nanoflare heating must come from pure spectroscopic measurements \citep[see][]{brosius_pervasive_2014}. Missions like the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS) \citep{kobayashi_marshall_2011,winebarger_new_2014}, with a wavelength range of 6-24 \ang and a temperature range of $6.2<\log{T}<7.2$, aim to probe this previously poorly-resolved portion of the coronal spectrum in hopes of better quantifying the presence of faint, high-temperature plasma.

\section{Forward Modeling}
\label{sec:charge_state}
%
%\hl{Talk about forward modeling procedure, why it is important, how it is done, CHIANTI, hydrodynamics, some nice pictures}
\par As discussed in \S\ref{sec:spectral_lines} and \S\ref{sec:dem}, interpreting observational results involves many assumptions and can potentially lead to misleading physical conclusions. Forward modeling, the calculation of observables from simulations, helps to cut out many of the assumptions often used when converting results from a particular instrument to interpretable observations. These simulated observables can then be directly compared to real observations. Additionally, forward modeling is also useful in the design of new instrumentation. If an instrument is being designed to observe a specific phenomenon (e.g. nanoflare heating), it should be designed such that its sensitivity corresponds to the regime in which such a phenomenon can be observed. Forward modeling techniques can be used to simulate the specific physical event and then map the results to the specified detector geometry in order to determine what equipment is necessary in order to capture a signal from the specified event.
%
\par Because of the wealth of data available to solar physicists, forward modeling is an invaluable tool, particularly in the study of coronal heating. For example, in an effort to diagnose what signal AIA/SDO would observe, given an impulsive heating event in an active region, \citet{bradshaw_what_2011} used the HYDRAD model \citep{bradshaw_influence_2013} to calculate temperature and density profiles as a function of time and loop coordinate, $T(s,t)$ and $n(s,t)$ for a variety of loop lengths, event durations and event amplitudes. These $T$ and $n$ values are then mapped from the loop geometry to the detector geometry as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:loop_detector_geom}. The observed intensity as a function of $s$ and $t$ in units of data numbers per pixel per second can then be calculated as
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{I}(\lambda,n,T)=\frac{(0.83)\times\mathrm{IR}(\lambda)\times\mathrm{Ab}_X\times X_i\times\epsilon(\lambda,n,T)\times(\mathrm{EM}_{pix}/A_{pix})}{4\pi\times(hc/\lambda)},
	\label{eq:fm_intensity}
\end{equation}
where $\mathrm{IR}(\lambda)$ is the instrument response function, $X_i$ is the population fraction of charge state $i$ of element $X$, $\epsilon$ is the emissivity of the line calculated using the CHIANTI atomic database and associated routines, $\mathrm{EM}_{pix}$ is the emission measure in the particular pixel, and $A_{pix}$ is the area of the pixel \citep{bradshaw_what_2011}.
%
\par When forward-modeling intensity in an impulsive heating scenario, $X_i$ is one of the most critical quantites. Higher charge states are created through collisional ionization. The charge state varies strongly with the temperature and weakly with the density; at higher kinetic energies (i.e. temperatures), free electrons are capable of ionizing even inner, strongly-bound electrons leading to higher charge states while at low kinetic energies, electrons are more easily captured in the outer bound states, leading to lower charge states \citep{bradshaw_collisional_2013}. The ionization state is determined by the equation
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial X_i}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial(X_iv)}{\partial s} = n(I_{i-1}X_{i-1} + R_iY_{i+1} - I_iX_i - R_{i-1}Y_i),
	\label{eq:ionization_state}
\end{equation}
where $v$ is the bulk flow velocity and $I_i$ and $R_i$ are the ionization and recombination rates for charge state $i$, respectively. Setting the lefthand side to zero amounts to assuming equilibrium ionization. However, in an impulsive heating scenario, the temperature changes so fast that there is a lag between the electron temperature and the temperature represented by spectral line emission. This is a consequence of the finite time that it takes for the ionization state to reach equilibrium. Solving Eq. \ref{eq:ionization_state} for a nonzero lefthand side allows one to properly take into account effects due to non-equilibrium ionization and thus correctly forward model emission from an impulsively-heated coronal loop. Fig. \ref{fig:fm_spectra} shows how the assumption of ionization equilibrium can affect the observed intensity, especially in the case of hot plasma, one of the most important signatures of nanoflare heating.

\par This thesis will study the effect of differing loop and heating parameters, such as event duration, amplitude distribution, and event frequency, on the resulting emission measure distribution. The emission measure will be calculated using the simple expression $\mathrm{EM}\mathrm{d}T=n^2L$, where $L$ is the loop length, rather than one of the reconstruction methods described in \S\ref{sec:dem}. In this way, the emission measure calculated here is the ground truth. In other word, effects due to observing or analysis techniques are not considered. Observables are then calculated by performing a linear fit on both the hotward and coolward slopes. Particular emphasis will be placed on the hotward slope calculations as few authors have concentrated on this portion of the emission measure distribution. Additionally, this portion of the plasma emission measure is also believed to characterize the properties of an impulsive coronal heating mechanism. Comparisons will be made to values reported in previous numerical studies and observational surveys.
